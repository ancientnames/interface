        <h1>Notes about Vans</h1>
        <h2>Driving a Van</h2>
            <p>
                Driving a van is a somewhat different experience than driving a car -- although someone who knows how to drive a car should easily be able to get the hang of a van. Key differences include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Blindspots
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The rearview mirror often has limited visibility because the rear window farther away, smaller than that of a car and often obstructed by cargo or the partition between the cab and cargo areas of the van. To make backing up easier, some vans have built in monitors on their control panels which display the records of a rearview camera when the van is in reverse. Rearview cameras can also be set-up on vans via license plate frame cameras.
                            </li>
                        </ul>    
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cargo vans lack passenger seats and therefore passenger windows, which means one cannot check for cars in adjacent lanes when merging simply by turning one's head to the left or right. Instead, side-mirrors on vans are often in two pieces -- a regular mirror which gives a general view of the left and right lanes and a convex mirror below it which gives a view of the parts of the road directly next to the van. As a result, someone new to vans but used to driving a car will need to get used to checking blindspots by looking in a mirror instead just turning their head.
                            </li>
                        </ul>      
                    </p>          
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Parking is much more difficult in a van by virtue of its large size. Vans are generally slightly wider than regular cars (e.g. a  UHaul van has a 5'7'' wheel-center to wheel-center width while a Toyota camry has a (roughly) 5'3'' wheel-center to wheel-center width). As a result, smaller parking spaces that leave a comfortable amount of room for cars may not be comfortable for vans (e.g. one side of the van will be very close to a parking line; it might not be possible to open a door; etc). Vans are also much longer than cars, which means a van will have to pull in deeper into the parking space than a car would -- and the angle of approach will need to be more accurate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Driving a van feels similar to driving a car in general but, because the van is longer, one should be sure to make wider turns to avoid cutting over curbs.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Renting a Van</h2>
            </p>
                An easy way to get a sense of what driving a van is like is by <a href="https://www.uhaul.com/Truck-Rentals/Cargo-Van/">renting one from UHaul</a>. The UHaul van rental process can be done almost entirely electronically. If you opt to do this, be sure that you are able to access your UHaul account on the UHaul website from your phone. In order to rent a UHaul, you will need to provide <a href="https://www.uhaul.com/reservations/reservationadvisements.aspx">a second form of verification upon rental</a>. In my opinion, the easist second form of verification is an additional contact phone (which they <em>will</em> call to verify). I asked a friend if I could use their phone as a secondary contact for UHaul and it worked (of course, make your friend aware that they should expect a call).
            </p>
            <p>
                While UHaul vans are pretty cheap in general, note that <b>a)</b> people trying out a van for the first time will probably want UHaul's $25 insurance policy to be on the safe side and <b>b)</b>UHaul charges $0.70 per mile driven. UHaul vans are <a href="https://www.reviews.org/moving/best-cargo-van-rentals/">9-foot Ford vans</a>. Specifically, UHaul vans are probably newer model Ford Transits based on what the company is <a href="https://trucksales.uhaul.com/">selling</a>.

                One can also rent a van in the United States using <a href="https://turo.com/us/en/van-rental/united-states">turo</a> (although I have not tried it). There is an extra fee for drivers under twenty five, but at least its possible.

        <h2>Types of Vans</h2>
            <p>
                The most common type of van is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van#Full-size_van">full-size van</a>. Vans often have different lengths with corresponding names -- <a href="https://sportsmobile.com/van-dimensions/">regular body, extended body and long body</a>. <a href="https://gnomadhome.com/build-your-van/">Chevy Express/GMC Savanna, Ford Econoline, Dodge Ram Van and Chevy van series</a> are the most typical cargo vans. Chevy Expresses have different variants with difference engines (e.g. Chevy Express 1500, Chevy Express 2500, Chevy Express 3500) which matter in terms of mileage before the engine dies: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/9a06wq/chevy_express_1500_vs_2500_vs_3500/">1500s last to around 150K miles while 3500s can last to 400K</a>.
