            Unlike a lot of people who have read the sort of things I read, I am not signed up for cryonics. It wouldn't be hard for me to sign up for cryonics: It wouldn't take much effort on my part and I already have the resources. Still, I have not signed up. I expect that, one day, I will close my eyes and my body and mind will be totally destroyed -- matter without information scattered across an infinite wasteland. Maybe, there are a number of reasons for this. But I think the main one is just that I don't really perceive my life as being <em>worth</em> it.

                say you are playing russian shoot-yourself-in-the-foot with one bullet and 6 chambers. if after pulling the trigger you observe that your foot is intact, does it make sense to feel relief?
                <br>
                <br>
                it makes sense or not in so far as aesthetics are instrumental and your visceralizations of reality are barometers for optimization rather than targets.
                <br>
                <br>
                in general, if you have a prior probability of seeing good world or bad world, it doesnt make sense to feel glad to observe a good world unless this observation is evidence that updates your priors.

            Whenever something bad has a <em>chance</em> of happening to you, you can imagine that (in some sense) it has actually really happened with certainty to a <em>fraction</em> of you. When it comes to pain, this is depressing -- it suggests that you are at all times <em>with certainty</em> in hell. This isn't something that you should spend energy haunting yourself over -- the parts of you already in hell are already haunted enough. Death feels a little different than this however. When you face a probabilty of death, part of you doesn't go on unalive as you go on live -- part of you just <em>goes away</em>. Your stake in the multiverse becomes smaller but there is no visceralization anywhere where things have gotten worse.

            To the extent that a person views their children as extensions of themselves -- their physiologically-imbued preferences and capabilities, their perspectives -- having children is a way of avoiding death a little bit. It allows a little bit of you (insofar as you can define yourself as a disparate but distinctly similar person as <em>you</em>) to continue on. If you believe this, then choosing not to have children is to sacrifice a future stake in the multiverse. In other words, choosing not to have children is to willfully die a little.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, to the extent that your parents think about children the <em>same way</em> (it is not an unusual way to think about children), your choice not to have children probably says something about whether your parents would choose to have children. After all, if you an an extension of your parents, then your choice about your children is an extension of your parents choice about you. The more likely it is that you will not have children, the more likely it is that your parents wouldn't have you and the smaller your <em>current</em> stake in the multiverse -- a significant fraction of possible yous has gone unborn by virtue of your reasoning.

            So when I choose, or at least <em>think</em> I will choose, not to have kids specifically I want to have not existed in this universe, I am in some sense already inviting my own death -- reducing my stake in the multiverse. I see cryonics through the same lens. Of course, I am still deeply afraid of death -- that old self-preservatory fear of perpetual and inevitable nothingness -- but cryonics does nothing to assuage that. Of course, there is a certain glimmer of something -- wouldn't it be quite nice to wake up on the moon? But it seems more aesthetic than real. I am a stoic and I live in approximate contentment but no one <em>optimizes</em> for contentment and it doesn't demand to be fought for. Contentment or death? It's always an infinite expanse and we're just arguing about the color.
