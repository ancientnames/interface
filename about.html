            I'm Pete Stone and this is my personal website, which doubles as a fancy blog. It's pretty simple -- just HTML with some CSS for the navigation panel. I split my stuff up into <em>reals</em> which talk about real world stuff, <em>fictions</em> which contains stories and story fragments I come up with, <em>thinkings</em> which contains more abstract thought and philosophy, and <em>about</em> -- which is where you are right now.

            I guess you might want to know something about me too. I studied math in college for practical reasons; run four miles every other day for physical reasons; and keep a vegan diet for ethical reasons. Pretty boring, huh?
