        <h1>Too Much of a Cold Thing</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Lars' dusty sneaker's</b> trudged across the asphalt crumbs scattered on the side of the road. A big red plastic ball shined brightly in the crook of his elbow. The sun was hot, the ground was warm, and the big red shiny plastic ball had certainly not expected to travel this far from the school building. Nevertheless, Lars had took it. It was his now. His.
        </p>
        <p>
            Somewhere else, kids scattered across a field of dry grass looked at each other uncertainly. Ordinarly, they'd go off to get slushies from the convenience store down the road but they didn't have the money this time. Or they had the money but didn't feel like mentioning it.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We don't have the ball anymore," Matthew finally said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wanna play tag?" another offered, to no response.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let's go get the ball back."
        </p>
        <p>
            After some gesturing to get everyone going in the same direction, Mathew's crew (or someone elses' -- they hadn't figured it out) went off to acquire a big red shiny plastic ball. Lars had taken it but no one knew why. Maybe he took it because he didn't want the rest of them to have it. Maybe he took it to impress a girl. Maybe he took it because he wanted to cut it up into tiny pieces and eat it. A month and a half ago, Mathew pushed a thin branch against a cicada's eye and slid it across the insects' face. Then he pinched the eye between his two fingers and put it in his mouth. It didn't taste like much and it didn't impress a girl.

            Lars' walk home would technically be long and simple. He'd walk alongside the road  until he passed the mechanic. Then he'd cross the road two more times and turn left. Then he'd continue forward until he approached the large red sedan parked in front of his house. At least, that was how it would work in theory. Lars had never walked this far. On his right, he saw a long chain-linked fence that reminded him of the one by the golf course by the park his parents had taken him to a couple times. Because they went by car, Lars assumed that the fence was far away.  If this was the same fence, and Lars couldn't rule that out, then he was in trouble. Nevertheless, the only way was forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lars wondered if the kids on the playground would follow him now that he had taken their ball. If they were going to follow him, he should cut left early so they couldn't see him from the road. However, doing this might mean that he'd get lost on a side-road he couldn't recognize -- which would be really bad if he was as far away as the chainlink fence by that park that his mom had brought him to. He decided to stay on the main road, where the cars would pass him every so often and he could stay on a nice wide sidewalk.
        <p>
            The ball wasn't even <em>theirs</em> anyway -- the big red ball Lars was carrying had been accidentally kicked into the forest about five weeks before by Matthew. No one brought it back after the teachers shouted about it after recess so they eventually wrote it off of the inventory list. Matthew noticed it sitting in the mud a couple weeks later after absentmindedly wandering back to where he had kicked it. Without recognition, he brought it back to play with.
