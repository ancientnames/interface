                There is a common saying often offered up when something bad happens to someone: "it could've been me." Explicitly, it is an acknowledgement that the speaker and victim were born of the same circumstances -- both sharing the risk of the bad thing. Practically, this means a number of things. First, it would be wise for the speaker to distance themself from the circumstances of the victim to mitigate a risk that has been made visceral through its realization in the victim. Second, anyone complicit in the victim's suffering would also be willing to be complicit in the speaker's suffering -- marking these people as the speaker's enemies. Third, and this is more of an intuitive thing, the possibility of counterfactual victimhood engenders direct empathy between the speaker and the victim: the sense that in some other world, <a href="https://somnilogical.tumblr.com/post/629176962127118336/say-you-take-a-driving-test-and-after-its-over">the speaker is literally the one who suffered.</a>

                When I was in high school, I was close with someone who almost killed themself -- I know this because they told me after the fact. That they didn't do it was a matter of coincidence; their uncle had attempted suicide that weekend and scared them off. When that happened, I felt in my mind a visceral splitting of words. There was the me at school, talking to them -- and there was the me mourning their death. And as I lived in the world I was in, I perhaps absentmindedly also traced out the path of my life in the world where they had died as if they actually had. I think that this was accurate.

                Whether you believe in a multiverse of superpositions (with every realizeable different in quantum mechanical outcome chaotically propagating across everything), a very large regular universe (so big that it becomes statistically inevitable that planets and people repeat themselves), or an exponential tree of simulations, odds are that any plausible sequence of outcomes has and is being realized by whatever sort of processes make up existence. If it could've been you -- it was.

            <p>
                But to know who you could've been, you must know who you <em>are</em>.

                B: "If you had felt their feelings, why would you expect to <em>remember</em>?"

                Well, if you care all possible versions of yourself, there are only so many ways to define <em>you</em>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You are a specific physical being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZMeftHfDV4">experiencing and integrating a unique set of circumstances</a> and nothing else. You aren't a copy of you -- you're the exact person you are right now tethered to this branch of possibility and attitude and so on. This happens when the specific concrete experiences that a physical system generates exactly circumscribes that system's self-identity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are a <em>class</em> of physical beings defined by a selected set of properties. Maybe you're the set of beings that enjoys art, or the set of physical beings with your encoded genetic material or the set of people who think in a particular way. You care about all physical beings in this class as you would for yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are, generally, <em>all</em> classes of being and care about all beings as you would for yourself.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But only one of these things isn't dumb! The first one is dumb because, if you're a specific physical being, you <em>don't</em> get to care about people who you could've been because -- after all -- they do not correspond to the specific experiences that circumscribe who you are. You also don't get to care about future-you because future you is receiving a different set of circumstances and processing them in a different way than those ways that define who you are. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                The second one is dumb (albeit more common) mostly because of its sheer arbitrariness.
            </p>
